# URL-shortener

This is a solution for a freeCodeCamp backend certification project, using express, dotenv, monodb, mongoose and nanoid.

I tried to improve my folder and file structure, in comparison to the one-file only approaches in the fcc curriculum, to get a more readable and easier to maintain application. 

I may use the core of this api for some mini-projects like my blog (which is currently under construction) or my portfolio website.
Therefore I would improve some aspects (mainly shorten the path of "/api/shorturl" to "/s") but in general I'm pretty happy with the main codebase, so I plan to use it as it is.
